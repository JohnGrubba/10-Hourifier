# 10-Hourifier

## Why?
Tired of using Premiere Pro to copy over the same video many times and rendering the whole video just for creating an 10 Hour Version of something?
This tool is here for you!
I have also made a .exe for Windows Users and a Linux Executable so you don't have to install any dependencies.
Free, Fast, OpenSource, Just Perfect (OpenSource because it was easy to make 😁)

## How?
With ffmpeg it is pretty easy to loop a video and the speed is only limited by your hard disk and CPU.
It doesn't render the whole Video but just copy it over and over which makes it more efficient than using a Video Editing Software.

## Thanks but you're bad at coding
Just open a Pull Request and do it better 😉
