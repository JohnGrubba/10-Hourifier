# 10-Hourifier

## Why?
Tired of using Premiere Pro and rendering the whole video just for creating an 10 Hour Version of something?


## How?
With ffmpeg it is pretty easy to loop a video and the speed is only limited by your hard disk and CPU.
It doesn't render the whole Video but just copy it over and over which makes it more efficient than using a Video Editing Software.

## Thanks but your bad at coding
Just open a Pull Request and do it better ðŸ˜‰
